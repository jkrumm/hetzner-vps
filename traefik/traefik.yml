## Traefik v3 — Static Configuration
## Deploy: doppler run -- docker compose up -d
##
## NOTE: This file does NOT support ${ENV_VAR} substitution.
## Domain-specific config (wildcard cert domains, ACME email) is handled via:
##   - TRAEFIK_CERTIFICATESRESOLVERS_LETSENCRYPT_ACME_EMAIL env var in compose.yml
##   - tls.domains labels on the dashboard router in compose.yml
