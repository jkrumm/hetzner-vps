# Disaster Recovery — restoring a PRODUCTION database from S3

> Restoring prod **overwrites the live database**. This is a last-resort
> operation. There is **no `make` target** for it on purpose. Read this whole
> page before you touch anything.

## What is allowed (and what isn't)

| Operation | How | Guarded? |
|-|-|-|
| Backup prod → S3 | `make backup` / `make fpp-backup` (+ nightly cron) | no — safe |
| Local ← prod (db→db) | `make sync-from-prod`, `make pg-sync-schema SCHEMA=…`, `make fpp-sync-from-prod` | dev-only, never touches prod |
| Local ← S3 | `make restore-local`, `make fpp-restore-local` | dev-only, never touches prod |
| **Prod ← S3 (restore)** | **scripts below — no make target** | **heavily gated** |

Nothing else writes to prod. The dev syncs always replace the **whole schema**
(or whole DB) — there is no partial/table-level operation to reason about.

## The guard on the prod-restore scripts

`scripts/restore-pg.sh` and `apps/fpp/scripts/restore-mariadb.sh` refuse to run
unless every gate passes:

1. **No passwordless sudo.** If `sudo` needs no password (the VPS runs NOPASSWD
   sudo), the script aborts. This blocks accidental runs on the server.
2. **Real sudo password.** It runs `sudo -v`, forcing a human to authenticate.
3. **Type the exact database name.** A final typed confirmation.

Because of gate 1, the normal path is blocked on the VPS. For a genuine
on-server recovery (the prod DB physically lives on the VPS), set
`BREAK_GLASS=1` to bypass gate 1 — you still face gates 2 and 3.

## Recovery procedure

### 1. Pick the backup version

```bash
# Postgres
op run --env-file=.env.tpl -- \
  aws s3 ls "s3://$AWS_S3_BUCKET/backups/vps/postgres/" --endpoint-url "$AWS_S3_ENDPOINT"
# MariaDB
op run --env-file=.env.tpl -- \
  aws s3 ls "s3://$AWS_S3_BUCKET/backups/vps/mariadb/" --endpoint-url "$AWS_S3_ENDPOINT"
```

Validate the chosen dump **first** without touching prod — restore it locally:

```bash
BACKUP_FILE=postgres_<db>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dump make restore-local   # dev box
```

### 2. Restore prod (on the VPS, deliberate)

```bash
ssh vps
cd ~/vps
BREAK_GLASS=1 BACKUP_FILE=postgres_<db>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dump \
  op run --env-file=.env.tpl -- ./scripts/restore-pg.sh
# MariaDB (interactive filename prompt):
BREAK_GLASS=1 op run --env-file=.env.tpl -- ./apps/fpp/scripts/restore-mariadb.sh
```

Answer the sudo prompt and type the database name when asked.

### 3. Re-apply grants

A prod restore drops and recreates the database, which wipes per-DB grants:

```bash
make postgres-setup        # Postgres — re-applies all schema roles/grants
make fpp-mariadb-setup     # MariaDB — re-applies the fpp user grants
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
make shell-postgres        # spot-check rows per schema
make fpp-shell             # spot-check fpp tables
```

## Postgres major-version upgrade

Same restore mechanism: `make backup`, bump the image tag in
`compose.infra.yml`, then restore into the new container via the gated
`scripts/restore-pg.sh` (or `pg_upgrade` in place). Always test on a copy first.
